# Chemicals
A Unity-based interactive chemistry lab simulator, where players can combine real-world compounds to trigger authentic chemical reactions like gas release, deposits, or color changes. The game is both educational and engaging, offering a hands-on experience in virtual experimentation.

## Game Description
In this simulator, players enter a virtual chemistry lab where they can:

- Interact with objects like bottles, bowls, and burners.

- Combine different chemical compounds.

- Observe realistic reactions such as gas emission, precipitation, or heat changes.

- Follow a step-by-step tutorial to learn game mechanics and controls.

**Objective**: Create a target number of valid compounds using available chemicals to win the game.

## Features
- Interactive Tutorial: Learn how to play using on-screen instructions.

- Realistic Reactions: Reactions are modeled after actual chemical behaviors.

- Object Inspection: Use the crosshair and HUD to inspect compounds and lab tools.

- Compound System: Logical backend combining rules to simulate chemistry.

- Immersive Controls: First-person view and mouse interactions with drag/drop and examine actions.

## Technologies Used
- Unity Engine: Game development and 3D interaction.

- C#: Core scripting for object behavior and logic (e.g., Compound.cs, Bottle.cs, Bowl.cs).

- Unity Input System: For player controls and interactivity.

- Custom Highlight/Inspect System: Scripts like HighlightObject.cs and InspectableObject.cs for immersive UX.

- Scene Management: Scenes like MainMenu, Game, and SampleScene structure the game flow.

##  Controls

- Mouse Left Click: Interact or inspect objects.

- Mouse Right Click: Combine compounds or back out.

- WASD: Move around the lab.

- Crosshair: Aim and select interactable items.
